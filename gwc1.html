          <h2>What is Renewable Energy?</h2>
          <p>
            Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished.
            For example, sunlight or wind are both types of renewable energy; they keep shining and blowing, even if their availability depends on time and weather.
            Renewable resources are virtually inexhaustible in duration but limited in the amount of energy that is available per unit of time.

          <h2>Why is Renewable Energy Important?</h2>
          <p>Up until the mid-19th century, wood was the source of nearly all of the nation's energy needs for heating, cooking, and lighting.
            From the late 1800’s until today, fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas have been the primary sources and account for about 80% of our energy needs.

            <br><br>However, the usage of these energy sources has exacted an enormous toll on the health of the planet and, by extension, the health of humanity.
            Land degradation, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, global warming, and ocean acidification are just a few of their harms.
            As such, it’s of utmost importance that we turn toward forms of renewable energy in the future to curb these detrimental effects.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Role of Renewable Energy in the US</h2>
          <p>Luckily, the United States is taking steps to implement more renewable energy sources (although many argue that the government is still not doing enough to combat climate change).
            The consumption of biofuels, geothermal, solar, and wind energy in the United States in 2019 was nearly three times greater than in 2000.
            The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. renewable energy consumption will continue to increase through 2050, which will play a significant role in reducing
            greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <h2><br>Solar Energy</h2>
          <p><br>According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, “more energy from the sun falls on the earth in one hour than is used by everyone in the world in one year.”
          <br><br>Throughout history, humans have relied on the sun for energy in the form of crops and warmth. Now, it can be used to warm water, heat buildings, and power devices.
          <br><br>Distributed solar systems generate electricity locally for homes and businesses, either through rooftop panels or community projects that power entire neighborhoods.
          Solar farms can generate power for thousands of homes, using mirrors to concentrate sunlight across acres of solar cells.
          Floating solar farms—or “floatovoltaics”—can be an effective use of wastewater facilities and bodies of water that aren’t ecologically sensitive.
          <br><br><br>Solar supplies a little more than 1 percent of U.S. electricity generation. Nearly a third of all new generating capacity came from solar in 2017, second only to natural gas.
          <br><br>Solar energy systems don’t produce air pollutants or greenhouse gases, and as long as they are responsibly sited, most solar panels have few environmental impacts beyond the manufacturing process.

          <h2><br>Wind Energy</h2>
          <p><br>In the present day, old-fashioned windmills have adapted into turbines as tall as skyscrapers—with turbines nearly as wide in diameter—that stand at attention around the world.
            Wind energy turns a turbine’s blades, which feeds an electric generator and produces electricity.
            <br><br>Wind, which accounts for a little more than 6 percent of U.S. generation, has become the cheapest energy source in many parts of the country.
            Top wind power states include California, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa, though turbines can be placed anywhere with high wind speeds—such as hilltops and open plains—or even offshore in open water.

          <h2><br><br>Hydroelectric Power</h2>
          <p><br>Hydropower is the largest renewable energy source for electricity in the United States (though wind energy is soon expected to take over the lead).
          Hydropower relies on water—typically fast-moving water in a large river or rapidly descending water from a high point—and converts the force of that water into electricity by spinning a generator’s turbine blades.
          <br><br>Large hydroelectric plants, or mega-dams, divert and reduce natural flows, restricting access for animal and human populations that rely on rivers.
          Small hydroelectric plants (an installed capacity below about 40 megawatts), carefully managed, do not tend to cause as much environmental damage, as they divert only a fraction of flow.

          <img src="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/photos/000/317/31712.jpg" alt="Biomass Energy" style = "padding-left: 300px; float:left">
          <h2><br>Biomass Energy</h2>
          <p><br>Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and includes crops, waste wood, and trees. When biomass is burned, the chemical energy is released as heat and can generate electricity with a steam turbine.
          Biomass is often mistakenly described as a clean, renewable fuel and a greener alternative to coal and other fossil fuels.
          However, recent science shows that many forms of biomass—especially from forests—actually produce higher carbon emissions than fossil fuels and harms biodiversity.
          <br><br>That being said, some forms of biomass energy could serve as a low-carbon option under the right circumstances. For example, sawdust and chips from sawmills that would otherwise quickly decompose and release carbon can be a low-carbon energy source.

          <h2><br>Geothermal Energy</h2>
          <p><br>The earth’s core is about as hot as the sun’s surface, due to the slow decay of radioactive particles in rocks at the center of the planet.
            Drilling deep wells brings very hot underground water to the surface as a hydrothermal resource, which is then pumped through a turbine to create electricity.
            <br><br>Geothermal plants typically have low emissions if they pump the steam and water they use back into the reservoir. There are ways to create geothermal plants where there are not underground reservoirs,
            but there are concerns that they may increase the risk of an earthquake in areas already considered geological hot spots.
          <br><br>Geothermal technology is a new take on a recognizable process—the coils at the back of your fridge are a mini heat pump, removing heat from the interior to keep foods fresh and cool.
          <br><br>In a home, geothermal or geoexchange pumps use the constant temperature of the earth (a few feet below the surface) to cool homes in summer and warm houses in winter—and even to heat water.
          <br><br>Geothermal systems can be initially expensive to install but typically pay off within 10 years. They are also quieter, have fewer maintenance issues, and last longer than traditional air conditioners.
