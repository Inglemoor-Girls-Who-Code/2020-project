  <h1>Deforestation</h1>
  <div id="introduction">
      <h2>What is deforestation?</h2>
      <p>Deforestation refers to the destruction or removal of trees by
          any means - intentional, accidental, or natural.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div id="causes">
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p><mark>Some the main causes of deforestation are agriculture, and fires</mark> - natural forest fires, as
          well as those that occur as a result of slash and burn agriculture. As the population increases, so does
          the need for food, and forests are often converted into farm or ranch land. And while forest fires can be
          beneficial, they can also be detrimental if occurring in the wrong place, too often, or too severely. The
          amount of forest lost to fires is equal to that of logging and agriculture combined. Fires can change the
          structure of forests, leave them vulnerable to invasive species, threaten biodiversity, as well as alter
          water cycles and soil fertility. <br>
          <br>
          <mark>Slash and burn agriculture</mark> is a method of cultivation in which forests are cut and
          burned. Farmers then plant crops in the soil fertilized by the ash. However, the land only remains
          fertile for a few years afterward, then it is abandoned.<br>
          <br>
          Additional causes of deforestation include: commerical logging and clearing land for cattle ranches, as well
          as plantations of profitable trees like rubber and oil palm.

  <div id="impact">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>Due to habitat loss, deforestation can lead to the extinction of both plant and animal species.
          Especially as <mark>about 70% of land animals</mark> live in forests. <br>
          <br>
          Trees maintain the balance of water in the environment, as well as prevent soil erosion.
          In deforested areas there is less water in the air that can be returned to the soil, leading to loss of
          soil arability. Without trees to prevent soil erosion, land can easily erode into rivers, landslides
          that damage homes and fields can occur as well. Some of the agricultural plants often used to replace
          trees can actually contribute to erosion. Since 1960, an estimated <mark>1/3 of the world's arable land</mark>
          has been lost to soil erosion. As more arable land is lost, farmers continue to clear more forest to make
          room for their plants, continuing the cycle. <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, rainforest canopies also help regulate temperature, without them temperature variation
          is significantly increased which can be severely detrimental to species in the rainforest.
          Tropical forests alone contain more than <mark>228 gigatons</mark> of carbon, which is more than
          7 times the ammount emmitted by people annually. When these forests are cut,
          they release the carbon into the the atmosphere. Deforestation and forest degradation account for
          <mark>15% of greenhouse gas emmissions.</mark> This contributes to aspects of climate change like global warming,
          weather and water pattern changes, and the increase in the number of extreme weather events. Changes
          in climate alter the environment of forests, making food and water less accessible. While some species may
          be able to adjust, others may not. <br>
          <br>
          The burning of tropical forests can also heavily effect air quality.

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <div id="stats2">
          <p>
              - About 2000 years ago, <mark>80%</mark> of Western Europe was forested. As of 2019, it has become
              <mark>34%.</mark><br>
              <br>
              - Around half the forests in eastern North America were cut in the time spanning the 1600s to the
              1870s.<br>
              <br>
              - <mark>Just over 20%</mark> of China is forested, having lost large amounts of forest over the past 4000 years.
              <br>
              <br>
              - At least <mark>772,204 square miles</mark> of land has been deforested and replaced with grazing pastures for cattle
              or sheep. <br>
              <br>
              - Cropland accounts for about <mark>18.9 million square miles</mark> of land, most of which was previously forested.
              <br>
              <br>
              - About <mark>1,931 square miles</mark> of the Amazon Rainforest is at least partially cleared annually.
              Partial logging leaves small patches of forest surrounded by cleared land, this can be extremely detrimental
              to wildlife.<br>
              <br>
              - The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the average rate of deforestation
              is currently <mark>501,932 square miles per decade.</mark>
