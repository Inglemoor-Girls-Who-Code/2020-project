    <h3> What is ocean acidification? </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>Ocean acidification occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) is absorbed by seawater, causing chemical reactions to occur that lower the seawater's pH.
Water and carbon dioxide combine to form carbonic acid, which breaks into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions that acidify the ocean.
From the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of ocean water has fallen by 0.1 pH units, almost a 30% increase, which can have widespread impact
on ocean life and human society as a whole.</p>

    <h3 id="humanheading"> Human causes </h3>
  </div>
<div class="body">
      <p> When the Industrial Revolution began around 200 years ago, humans began to burn increasing amounts of fossil fuels to supplement industrial energy needs. Since then, the ocean has absorbed
almost 525 billion tons of CO2, almost 22 million tons a day. The burning of these fuels has led to a greater concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The ocean, which absorbs 30% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is subsequently heavily impacted. In the present day, the burning of coal, oil, and gass, car emissions, deforestation,
and other human activities continue to contribute to this increase of carbon dioxide, at levels previously unprecedented. Ocean acidification is the direct byproduct of human driven climate change,
and our society bears most, if not all, responsibility.</p>

    <h3> Impacts </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
      <p> Many ocean species have already been impacted, particularly shell-building organisms. Usually, oysters and corals build shells using calcium and carbonate, but as the presence of
acidic ions increases, carbonate increasingly bonds with hydrogen, leading to less material available for shell-building. Moreover, if the pH drops too low, shells and skeletons can
began to dissolve. An experiment done with pteropod shells found that when the animals were placed in ocean water with an acidity projected for the year 2100, their shells dissolved
after only 45 days. Even now, researchers have discovered severe shell dissolution in parts of the ocean.

Changing ocean chemistry can also affect the behavior of marine organisms. For example, the ability of clownfish to detect predators and locate habitats are hindered by acidified pH levels.
These factors can affect their survival, leading to widespread and far-reaching impacts across the marine ecosystem. In humans, a small change in blood pH can cause seizures, comas, and death.
For fish, the body must burn extra energy to excrete the excess acid, slowing growth and the fish's ability to excape from predators or catch food.

More notably, the destruction of coral reefs eliminates crucial oceanic habitats, affecting the many thousands of aquatic organisms that make the reefs their home.

In contrast, planst and algae may thrive under acidic conditions, as carbon dioxide is a crucial source of energy for photosynthesis. Seagrasses, in particular, may be able to grow taller
and deeper roots in acidic conditons.

Looking to the future, natural buffering is not an option to resolve acidity, as it has been in the past. As ecosystems and organisms suffer under such conditions, ocean acidification will
surely have gargantuan impacts on our planet in the foreseeable future. </p>

    <div class="subheadings">
    <h3> Why does this matter? </h3>
  </div>
<div class="body">
      <p> Ocean acidification doesn't just affect animals, it affects us. Billions of people worldwide rely on food from the ocean, and in the United States, many jobs and economies depend opn the oceanic
ecosystem. As organisms are disrupted by and diminish in number from low pH, entire food webs will be affected, potentially cutting off important food sources. By 2100, the global annual cost for
the loss of mollusks alone is expected to be over $100 billion. Additionally, tourism to marine ecosystems would result in losses of billions of dollars worldwide.
Another risk is diminsihed coastal protection. Marine ecosystems protect shorelines from cyclones and storm surges; without them, island nations would be at risk.
Lastly, and most pressingly, as the capacity of the ocean to absorb CO2 diminishes, so does its ability to moderate climate change. Our society therefore faces a number of critical risks if ocean
acidification is not addressed. </p>

    <h3 id="helpheading"> How can you help? </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
      <p> Support current research and rescue efforts for causes related to climate change and ocean acidification. Advocate with local policy makers to place constraints on emissions and for more sustainable
energy use in your local community. Within your own home, you can reduce your energy use by turning off unused lights and supporting clean energy. Choose to use public transportation, walk, or bike, over driving.
Monitor changes to your car, like tire pressure, to minimize gas consumption. These small acts can help reduce your carbon footprint. More importantly, spread the word. Ocean acidification has only been recognized
in recent years and many are still uneducated or unaware of the issue. Educating your classmates and family members can crate community consciousness in reducing energy use. Through these small steps, we can work
together to save the oceans that provide livelihood and income to our society, and homes to many creatures. </p>
