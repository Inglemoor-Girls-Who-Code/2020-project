    <h2 class=p2 id=text-left >What is Coral Bleaching?</h2>
      <p class=p1 id="text-left" "paragraph">Corals are the result of a mutualistic relationship between coral polyps and zooxanthellae algae. The coral protects the algae within its tissues and supplies it with the compounds they need for photosynthesis. In return, the algae give the coral its color, removes its waste, and provide the coral with oxygen. However, when corals become stressed from changes in the environment, they expel the algae, revealing the white skeleton underneath and taking on a bleached look. In this state, the coral has lost its main source of food, and it is now more vulnerable to disease. Luckily, bleached coral isn’t dead, though prolonged algae loss and stress can lead to the coral’s death. Yet if conditions quickly return to normal, the coral is able to recover. </p><br>

    <h2 class=p2 id=text-right>Causes</h2>
      <p class=p1 id="text-right" "right-align">The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change, though pollution, overexposure to sunlight, and extreme low tides are also responsible.  A rise in ocean temperatures causes more frequent bleaching due to thermal stress. Storm precipitation, as well as runoff containing pollutants, dilutes ocean water, which can bleach near-shore corals. High solar irradiance paired with extreme low tides and exposure to the air can result in the bleaching of shallow-water corals.

    <h2 class=p2 id=text-left>Impact</h2>
      <p class=p1 id=text-left>There is only a slim chance that reefs will come back if corals die, as the ecosystem will continue to deteriorate. For wildlife, coral reefs provide shelter and a spawning ground and support the organisms at the bottom of the food chain. Thousands of marine animals depend on reefs to survive, such as sea turtles, fish, crabs, shrimp, jellyfish, sea birds, and starfish. As for humans, coral reefs keep coastal communities safe by acting as natural barriers that absorb the force of waves and storm surges. Without them, communities must rely on man-made swells, which are expensive, less effective, and environmentally damaging to construct. This also deprives animals a place to spawn and develop, resulting in a lack of food for the people who rely on these species. </p><br>

    <h2 class=p2 id=text-right>How You can Help</h2>
      <p class=p1 id="text-right" "right-align">You can help by avoiding lawn pesticides, driving less, recycling, using energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs, printing less, using less water, learning good reef etiquette, and volunteering for beach or waterway clean up.</p><br><br><br><br>
