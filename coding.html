/*introduction*/
<div id="pollution">
<p> Pollution is a serious problem in our world today. In fact, we pollute every day without even knowing! Take for example, your car. Even that smoke coming out of the car’s exhaust pipes can have a serious impact on the environment. However, not all pollutants are human created. Some pollutants are natural, such as algae blooms or volcanic ash. While pollution is inevitable, we can still play our part and help save our environment.

Although there are multitudes of pollution types, there are three main ones - air, water, and land. Each one is equally detrimental to our environment, and even our health! The paragraphs down below gives an overview of each type of pollution, and explores the costs of it has on us.

/*paragraph 1 - air pollution*/
<div id="Air Pollution">
<h2> Air Pollution </h2>
<p1> The process of releasing pollutants into the air is known as air pollution. Being exposed to air pollution is very dangerous. It can have serious effects on our bodies, and if we are exposed long enough, it can lead to diseases  such as lung cancer. In some cases, air pollution can be fatal. 4.2 million deaths, caused by outdoor air pollution, occur every year. But what are some of the causes? One common cause comes from our motor vehicles. They produce many harmful chemicals like carbon monoxide that end up in our air. Wildfires, a natural pollutant, also release many dangerous chemicals into the air. However, these are only two causes out of many that poison our environment.

/*paragraph 2 - water pollution*/
<div id="water pollution">
<h2> Water Pollution </h2>
<p1> Water, including lakes, rivers, and oceans, are constantly being contaminated by detrimental materials. These materials include things like garbage or even chemicals that you can’t see. Many things cause water pollution, even simple things like rain! For example, that rain causes materials like waste or pesticides to seep into our bodies of water. Although we may not realize it, the effects are very costly. For instance, constant exposure to bad water can shorten lives. In addition, it kills many aquatic animals and poisons their environment.

/*paragraph 3 - land pollution*/
<div id="land pollution">
<h2> Land Pollution </h2>
<p1> Land pollution is a term for when waste is present, or contaminating the surface. One cause of land pollution comes from the garbage that we produce. The trash ends up in a landfill, and then chemicals from the trash leak out into the ground, poisoning our soil. Construction is another cause of land pollution. When the materials are not disposed of properly, it adds to the pollution of the land. There are many detrimental effects of land
  pollution, including climate change, and the extinction of wildlife species. These examples are just a few of so many that contribute to the contamination of our earth.
