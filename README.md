Wildfires:

        </h1>
        <h2>
The mass of predictions for how climate change will present its self in the northwest is through wildfires.  “Fire frequency and intensity have already increased in the past 50 years, and most notably the past 15 years in the shrub steppe and forested regions of the West.” “Drought and hotter temperatures have also led to an increase in outbreaks of insects, such as the mountain pine beetle, increasing the risk of fire.”
